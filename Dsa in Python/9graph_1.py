# ---------Graph
'''A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. 
The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines that connect any two nodes in the graph. 
More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). 
The graph is denoted by G(E, V).

# ------Applications of Graph
'''
1.Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. 
2.Graphs are used to represent networks. 
3.The networks may include paths in a city.
4.Telephone network.
5.circuit network. 
6.Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. 
For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). 
Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, location etc.

# ------Graph Operations
'''
The most common graph operations are:
1.Check if the element is present in the graph
2.Graph Traversal
3.Add elements(vertex, edges) to graph
4.Finding the path from one vertex to another
